Full Replit Prompt (No Guest, Node.js + Supabase + Render + AI + Advanced UI/UX):
Build a full-stack Node.js language learning web app with Supabase (for authentication: signup, login, confirm email, forgot password, change email), deployable to Render. Do not implement a guest mode — all users must be authenticated.

The platform allows users to chat with an AI that teaches them a language. When the user logs in for the first time, the app should ask:
“What language do you want to study?”
That language becomes their primary study language and is stored in the database (Supabase).

From then on, the AI automatically chats in that language. The user can still ask questions in any language, but the replies default to the study language unless changed. The AI should also detect user mistakes and offer gentle corrections.

✅ AI Chat System (Language Learning-Focused)

AI prompts user to select a language to study

AI uses that language in replies by default

AI highlights grammar mistakes, suggests corrections

Messages have optional translation overlay (under each message)

Color-code translation: verbs (red), nouns (blue), adjectives (green), particles (gray), etc.

✅ Interactive Learning Features

Users can highlight text in either their own or AI’s messages

Highlight menu shows:

“Explain this” → grammatical + usage breakdown

“Translate” → inline translation (preserves color coding)

“Break this down” → splits sentence into vocab + grammar parts

“Add to vocab list” → opens save dialog with custom tags/notes

Saved words/phrases stored in Supabase per user

✅ Study Tools Section

Vocab page with saved items + tags

Flashcard practice mode (spaced repetition, reveal definition, quiz mode)

Sentence practice: AI generates cloze tests using saved words

Daily review: 5 flashcards + 1 cloze test per day

✅ UI/UX Requirements

Claude-style aesthetic: minimal, elegant, feminine-leaning

Rounded cards, light neutral tones, wide padding, soft shadows

App-like feel: use sticky bottom nav on mobile, fluid transitions, modals/panels for vocab and settings

Chat screen should feel like a mobile app (single-column focus)

Sidebar/drawer on desktop with: Home, Vocab, Practice, Settings

✅ Account Management (Supabase)

Login, signup, email confirmation

Forgot password flow

✅ Deployment / Stack

Backend: Node.js

Authentication & DB: Supabase

Hosting: Render

Should work in both dev and deployed environments

Ability to toggle between beginner/intermediate/advanced mode

Tooltip hints for grammar breakdowns

Progress tracking (XP or streak system, stored in Supabase)

Do not use generic ChatGPT clone layout. This is a specialized language-learning platform with advanced interactivity and must reflect that in both the UX and feature integration. Prioritize polish, responsiveness, and feature cohesion.

“Which language would you like to study?”

This sets the context for the AI automatically.

Store this in Supabase per user or localStorage for guests.
